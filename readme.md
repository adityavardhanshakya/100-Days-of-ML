Artificial Intelligence (AI):
Definition: AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. It involves creating algorithms and systems that can simulate human cognitive functions such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Example: AI systems can be found in virtual personal assistants (like Siri or Alexa), recommendation systems (like Netflix's movie suggestions), and autonomous vehicles.

Machine Learning (ML):
Definition: ML is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that enable computers to learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed for a task, ML algorithms can learn patterns and make predictions or decisions based on examples.

Example: Spam filters in email, image recognition software, and predicting stock prices are applications of machine learning.

Deep Learning (DL):
Definition: Deep Learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). These networks can automatically learn to represent data through the hierarchy of features. DL is particularly powerful in handling complex and large datasets.

Example: Deep Learning is commonly used in image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.

Summary:
AI is the overarching concept of creating intelligent machines that can mimic human behavior.
ML is a subset of AI, focusing on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn patterns and make decisions from data.
DL is a subset of ML that uses deep neural networks to automatically learn and represent data in a hierarchical manner.
